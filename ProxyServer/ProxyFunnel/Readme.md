# This is a small server that has its own IP on the machine. Traffic is funnelled through it and then to the outside world. It does nothing to the traffic

## Plans: 
	1. Create a server that listens on a port
	2. route traffic through in Firefox.
	3. Add SSL certificate to the server
	4. Output the traffic to a file.
